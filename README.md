# Project 5
## Implementation / Features you added
In project 5 i created a psyc-horror game where you, the player, are a construction worker who has gone mad.
You, in a fit of rage begin smashing every brick you can see, with only one objective. 
To kill th emaster brick ( the biggest one ) 
One it is dead you are free. Or so I am told. 
- The features I added were
- multiple textures
- Lights
- Menus
